This repository contains an analysis aimed at supporting Zomato's expansion strategy by identifying potential countries, cities, and cuisines for new restaurant openings. Key insights include the number of restaurants by country, year-wise trends, price range distribution, and the impact of services like online delivery on ratings. Excel functions like VLOOKUP, COUNTIFS, and Pivot Tables were used for data analysis, with visualizations created using bar, line, and stacked charts.

The interactive dashboard is available in the Newz.xlsx file, and a presentation summarizing the findings is provided in the Zomato_Expansion_Analysis.ppt.
